**ETL CHALLENGE**

The purpose of the challenge is to understand how to extract, transform, and load the data. I am using the Spotify API, and through my Python script, I am connecting to the database I created from the PostgreSQL shell to then manipulate the API and send the values to the 'artists' table that I created.

I am visualizing the table from pgAdmin 4.
